Include BDDTelevision as Maven project in Eclipse 
Chrome browser should be installed on your PC
The tests are described at feature file: Scenario.feature (/BDDTelevision/src/test/resources/Scenario.feature)
I implemented the following tests using Java, Selenium WebDriver and TestNG:
#1:Go to Best Buys page
#2:Go to Advice Guides page
#3:Open a TV product summary page
#6:Filter by brand
#11:Sort by Price(low to high)
#12:Check Sort By Dropdown 

To run it: 
- use TestNG to run WichTelevisionTest test (/BDDTelevision/src/test/java/pages/frontend/WichTelevisionTest.java)
